Figma assets for the NHS design system

Figured it would be useful to have a system of drag and drop elements, that work in conjunction with the (fantastic) nhs prototyping kit for folks that perhaps aren't keen on running the coded version. I couldn't find any figma versions of the NHS design, so made my own. 

Currently I've converted the colours and text, over time, and depending on how far I get, i'll try to add components as I go.

## Installing

These are saved in a .fig file, which, for some reason can't be opened via the finder. Instead open figma desktop app and drag the file into your workspace â€“ it'll be added to your projects

You can then move the file to the project folder with your NHS prototypes. 

You'll need to 'publish' the design system file, do this by opening the file and clicking the down arrow at the top next to the file name, and selecting publish (top of the list).

Then this will make the style elements available to all files within that project.

## Using

You can use these colours and fonts by clicking on the 4 dots in the typography and colour section of the figma right-hand menu.
